This is a command line tool for managing Gnome keyring for Gnome Desktop.
Originally developed and provided as part of CollabNet Subversion command line
client binaries for Linux and Solaris. This is useful when you need to use
the keyring in an environment without a GUI such as an SSH terminal session
into a remote server.
